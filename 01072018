I got up at around 8:04 am in the morning and ate three eggs. At about 11:35am, I left my house and walked to 36th St station to take a train, which turns out to be the R, which I almost missed in the last second. I switched to 4 train at Whitehall St Station, and got off at Fulton St Station, as I was going to the Smart Indian Cuisine to buy Chicken Biryani. To my dismay, it was closed on this day. :-( Therefore, I tried to find some other restaurant to take my lunch. In less than a minute, I found Sticky Chicken, which is around the corner on the other side of the street. I ordered the medium side Chicken Finger and French Fries, which is good, especially when you are hungry.
At about 12:50 pm, I came to the Starbucks and began studying how to create a personal portfolio of web development through viewing YouTube videos. (2:07 pm)
